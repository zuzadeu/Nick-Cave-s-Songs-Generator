Buddha said, don’t cry Go to each house and collect a mustard seed But only from a house where no one’s died Kisa went to each house in the village My baby’s getting sicker, poor Kisa cried But Kisa never collected one mustard seed Because in every house someone had died Kisa sat down in the old village square She hugged her baby and  cried and cried She said everybody is always losing somebody Then walked into the forest and buried her child Everybody’s losing someone Everybody’s losing someone It’s a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind It’s a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind And I’m just waiting now for my time to come And I’m just waiting now for peace to come For peace to come\n",

And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be This is what she does and this is what she is. And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be This is what she does and this is what she is. Her eyes that look at me through her rainy hair are two round holes where the air buckles and rushes in, her body moon-blue as a jellyfish, and I’m breathing deep and I’m there and I’m also not there and spurting ink over the sheets but she remains, completely unexplained or maybe I’m just too tongue-tied to drink it up and swallow back the pain. I thought slavery had been abolished, how come it’s gone and reared its ugly head again. And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be This is what she does and this is what she is. And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be This is what she is and this is what she does. This is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be And this is what she does and this is what she is. And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be This is what she does and this is what she is. And now she’s jumping up with her leaping brain, stepping over heaps of sleeping children, disappearing and further up and spinning out again, up and further up she goes, up and out of the bed, up and out of the bed and down the hall where she stops for a moment and turns and says “Are you still here?” and then reaches high and dangles herself like a child’s dream from the ring of Saturn.\n",

Oh I hate them, Pa! Oh I hate them all for what they went and done to you Oh Lord Oh my Lord Oh Lord How have I offended thee? Wrap your tender arms round me Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh My Lord\n",
