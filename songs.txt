Once there was a song\s The song yearned to be sung\s It was a spinning song\s About the king of rock ‘n’ roll
The king was first a young prince\s The prince was the best\s With his black jelly hair\s He crashed onto a stage in Vegas
The king had a queen\s The queen’s hair was a stairway\s She tended the castle garden\s And in the garden planted a tree
The garden tree was a stairway\s It was sixteen branches high\s On the top branch was a nest\s Sing the high cloudy nest
In the nest there was a bird\s The bird had a wing\s The wing had a feather\s Spin the feather and sing the wind
The king in time died\s The queen’s heart broke like a vow\s And the tree returned to the earth\s With the nest and the bird
But the feather spun upward\s Upward and upward\s Spinning all the weather vanes\s And you’re sitting at the kitchen table\s Listening to the radio
And I love you\s And I love you\s And I love you\s And I love you\s And I love you\s And I love you\s And I love you
Peace will come\s Peace will come\s Peace will come in time
A time will come\s A time will come\s A time will come for us
Peace will come\s Peace will come\s Peace will come in time
A time will come\s A time will come\s A time will come for us\sThe bright horses have broken free from the fields\s They are horses of love, their manes full of fire\s They are parting the cities, those bright burning horses\s And everyone is hiding, no one makes a sound\s And I’m by your side and I’m holding your hand\s Bright horses of wonder springing from your burning hand
And everyone has a heart and it’s calling for something\s And we are all so sick and tired of seeing things as they are\s Horses are just horses and their manes aren’t full of fire\s And the fields are just fields and there ain’t no Lord\s And everyone is hidden and everyone is cruel\s And there is no shortage of tyrants and no shortage of fools\s And the little white shape dancing at the end of the hall\s Is just a wish that time can’t dissolve at all
This world is plain to see\s It don’t mean we can’t believe\s In something and any way\s My baby’s coming back now\s On the next train\s I can hear the whistle blowing\s I can hear the mighty roar\s I can hear the horses prancing\s In the pastures of the Lord\s Oh the train is coming\s And I’m standing here to see\s And it’s bringing my baby\s Right back to me\s Well there are some things\s That are hard to explain\s But my baby’s coming home now\s On the 5.30 train\sAll through the night we drove\s And the wind caught her hair\s And we parked on the beach\s In the cool evening air\s Well, sometimes it’s better not to say anything at all
Your body is an anchor\s Never asked to be free\s Just want to stay in the business\s Of making you happy\s Well, I’m just waiting for you\s Waiting for you\s Waiting for you\s Waiting for you\s Waiting for you\s Waiting for you
A priest runs through the chapel\s All the calendars are turning\s A Jesus freak on the street\s Says He is returning\s Well, sometimes a little bit of faith\s Can go a long, long way
Your soul is my anchor\s I never asked to be freed\s Well, sleep now, sleep now\s Take as long as you need\s Cause I’m just waiting for you\s Waiting for you\s Waiting for you\s Waiting for you\s Waiting for you\s Waiting for you\s To return\s To return\s To return\sThere’s a picture of Jesus lying in his mother’s arms\s Shuttered windows, cars humming on the street below\s The fountain throbbed in the lobby of the Grand Hotel\s We checked into room thirty-three well, well
You were a runaway flake of snow\s You were skinny and white as a wafer, yeah I know\s Sitting on the edge of the bed clicking your shoes\s I slid my little songs out from under you
And we all rose from our wonder\s We would never admit defeat\s And we leaned out of the window\s As the rain fell on the street\s On the street
They were just a sigh released from a dying star\s They were runaway flakes of snow, yeah I know\s They annexed your insides in a late night raid\s We sent down for drinks and something to eat\s The cars humming in the rain on the street below
A fountain throbs in the lobby of the Grand Hotel\s The spurting font of creativity, yeah I know\s Your head in a pool of your own streaming hair\s And Jesus lying in his mother’s arms, just so\s Up on the wall, just so
And we all rose up from our wonder\s We will never admit defeat\s And we leaned out of the window\s And watched the horses in the street\sI lay in the forest amongst the butterflies and the fireflies and the burning horses and the flaming trees, as a spiral of children climb up to the sun, waving goodbye to you and goodbye to me as the past pulls away and the future begins, I say goodbye to all that as the future rolls in, like a wave, like a wave, and the past with its savage undertow, lets go.
Come on everyone, come on everyone\s A spiral of children climbs up to the sun\s To the sun, to the sun, and on each golden rung\s A spiral of children climbs up to the sun
And a man called Jesus, he promised he would leave us with a word that would light up the night, oh the night, but the stars hang from threads and blink off one by one and it isn’t any fun no it isn’t any fun to be standing here alone with nowhere to be with a man mad with grief and on each side a thief and everybody hanging from a tree, from a tree, and everybody hanging from a tree.
Come on everyone, come on everyone\s A spiral of children climbs up to the sun\s To the sun, to the sun, taking everyone\s A spiral of children climbs up to the sun
There is nothing more valuable than beauty, they say, there is nothing more valuable than love and I lie amongst the leaves and the burning trees and the fields of smoke and the black butterflies and the screaming horses and your bright green eyes so beautiful, your bright green eyes, so beautiful.
I am here\s Beside you\s Look for me\s In the sun\s I am beside you\s I am within\s In the sunshine\s In the sun\sIf I could sail a galleon ship\s Long lonely rider cross the sky\s Seek out mysteries while you sleep\s And treasures money cannot buy
For you know I see you everywhere\s A servant girl, an empress\s My galleon ship would will fly and fall\s Fall and fly and fly and fall\s Deep into your loveliness
And if we rise, my love\s Before the daylight comes\s A thousand galleon ships would sail\s Ghostly around the morning sun
As the city rises up\s As the city rises up\s As the city rises up\s As the city rises up
For we are not alone it seems\s So many riders in the sky\s The winds of longing in their sails\s Searching for the other side
And if we rise, my love\s Oh my darling precious one\s We’ll stand and watch the galleon ships\s Circle around the morning sun\sI am beside you\s I am beside you\s I am beside you\s I am beside you\s Look for me\s Look for me\s I am beside you\s Look for me\s I try to forget\s To remember\s That nothing is something\s Where something is meant to be\s I am beside you\s I am beside you\s Look for me\s Look for me\s Well, I think they’ve gathered here for me\s I am within you\s You are within me\s I am beside you\s You are beside me\s I think they’re singing to be free\s I think they’re singing to be free\s I think my friends have gathered here for me\s I think they’ve gathered here\s To be beside me\s Look for me\s Look for me\s I am beside you\s You are beside me\s You are beside me\s Look for me\sOh my oh my oh my\s I love my baby and my baby loves me\s Oh my oh my oh my\s I love my baby and my baby loves me
We talked it round and round again\s Then drove the car down to the sea\s We sat in the car park for an hour or two\s I love my baby and my baby loves me
I love my baby and my baby loves me\s It’s vast and wild and it’s deep as the sea\s And as the sun sinks into the water\s I love my baby and my baby loves me
Oh my oh my oh my\s Oh my oh my oh my\s I love my baby and my baby loves me\s Oh my oh my oh my\s Oh my oh my oh my\s I love my baby and my baby loves me\sThis world is beautiful\s Held within its stars\s I keep it in my heart\s The stars are your eyes\s I loved them right from the start\s A world so beautiful\s And I keep it\s In my heart
A ghosteen dances in my hand\s Slowly twirling, twirling, all around\s Glowing circle in my hand\s Dancing, dancing, dancing, all around
A ghosteen dances in my hand\s Slowly twirling, twirling, all around\s A ghosteen dances in my hand\s Dancing, dancing, dancing, all around
There goes the moonlit man\s Got a suitcase in his hand\s He’s moving on down the road\s Things tend to fall apart\s Starting with his heart\s He kisses you lightly and he leaves\s Leaves your sleeping body\s Curled and dreaming around your smile\s Around your smile
The three bears watch the TV\s They age a lifetime, O Lord\s Mama Bear holds the remote\s Papa Bear he just floats\s And Baby Bear he has gone\s Gone to the moon in a boat\s Oh in a boat
I’m speaking about love now\s How the lights of love go down\s You’re in the back room washing his clothes\s Love’s like that you know\s It’s like a tidal flow\s And the past with its fierce undertow\s Won’t ever let us go\s Won’t ever let you go
If I could move the night I would\s And I would turn the world around if I could\s There is nothing wrong with loving something\s You can’t hold in your hand\s You’re sitting on the edge of the bed\s Smoking and shaking your head\s Well there’s nothing wrong with loving things\s That cannot even stand
Well, there goes your moony man\s With his suitcase in his hand\s Every road is lined with animals\s That rise from their blood and walk\s Well  the moon won’t get a wink of sleep\s If I stay all night and talk\s If I stay all night and talk\sJesus lying in his mother’s arms\s Is a photon released from a dying star\s We move through the forest at night\s The sky is full of momentary light\s Everything we need is just too far\s We are photons released from a dying star\s We are fireflies a child has trapped in a jar\s And everything is as distant as the stars\s I am here and you are where you are
We have lived a long time here in the forest\s We lie beneath the heaps of leaves\s We are partial to this partial light\s We cannot sleep and fear our dreams\s There is no order here, nothing can be planned\s We are fireflies trapped in a little boy’s hand\s And everything is as distant as the stars\s I am here and you are where you are
We lie among our atoms and I speak to you of things\s And hope sometimes that maybe you will understand\s There is no order here and there is no middle ground\s Nothing can be predicted and nothing can be planned\s A star is just the memory of a star\s We are fireflies pulsing dimly in the dark\s We are here and you are where you are\s<p style="text-align: left;">The fires continued through the night\s The kid with a bat face appeared at the window\s Then disappeared into the headlights
I was halfway to the Pacific Coast\s I had left you in your longing\s In your yearning like a ghost
There is little room for wonder, now\s And little room for wildness too\s We crawl into our wounds\s I’m nearly all the way to Malibu
I’m gonna buy me a house up in the hills\s With a tear-shaped pool and a gun that kills\s Cause they say there is a cougar that roams these parts\s With a terrible engine of wrath for a heart\s That she is white and rare and full of all kinds of harm\s And stalks the perimeter all day long\s But at night lays trembling in my arms
And I’m just waiting now for my time to come\s And I’m just waiting now for my time to come\s And I’m just waiting now for my place in the sun\s And I’m just waiting now for peace to come
And I’m just waiting now for my time to come\s And I’m just waiting now for my time to come\s And we hide in our wounds\s And I’m nearly all the way to Malibu\s And I know my time will come one day soon\s I’m waiting for peace to come\s I’m nearly all the way to Malibu\s Oh babe, we’re on the run, we’re on the run\s Half down the Pacific Coast\s Well I left you sleeping like a ghost\s In your wounds
Darling your dreams are your greatest part\s I carry them with me in my heart\s Darling your dreams were your greatest part\s I carry them with me in my heart\s Somewhere, don’t know
Now I’m standing on the shore\s All the animals roam the beaches\s And sea creatures rise out of the sea.\s And I’m standing on the shore\s Everyone begins to run\s The kid drops his bucket and spade\s And climbs into the sun

Kisa had a baby but the baby died\s Goes to the villagers says my baby’s sick\s Villagers shake their heads and say to her\s Better bury your baby in the forest quick
It’s a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind\s It’s a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
Kisa went to the mountain and asked the Buddha\s My baby’s sick Buddha said, don’t cry\s Go to each house and collect a mustard seed\s But only from a house where no one’s died
Kisa went to each house in the village\s My baby’s getting sicker, poor Kisa cried\s But Kisa never collected one mustard seed\s Because in every house someone had died
Kisa sat down in the old village square\s She hugged her baby and  cried and cried\s She said everybody is always losing somebody\s Then walked into the forest and buried her child
Everybody’s losing someone\s Everybody’s losing someone\s It’s a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind\s It’s a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind\s And I’m just waiting now for my time to come\s And I’m just waiting now for peace to come\s For peace to come\sYou fell from the sky\s Crash landed in a field\s Near the river Adur\s Flowers spring from the ground\s Lambs burst from the wombs of their mothers\s In a hole beneath the bridge\s She convalesce, she fashioned masks of twigs and clay\s You cried beneath the dripping trees\s Ghost song lodged in the throat of a mermaid\s With my voice\s I am calling you\s You’re a young man waking\s Covered in blood that is not yours\s You’re a woman in a yellow dress\s Surrounded by a charm of hummingbirds\s You’re a young girl full of forbidden energy\s Flickering in the gloom\s You’re a drug addict lying on your back\s In a Tijuana hotel room\s With my voice\s I am calling you\s With my voice\s I am calling you\s You’re an African doctor harvesting tear ducts\s You believe…\sUpside down and inside out and on all eights like a funnel web, like a black fly on the ceiling, skinny white haunches high and skyward and her black oily gash, crawling backwards across the carpet to smash all over everything her wet, black fur against the sun going down over the shops and the cars and the crowds and the town.
And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be\s This is what she does and this is what she is.\s And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be\s This is what she does and this is what she is.
Her eyes that look at me through her rainy hair are two round holes where the air buckles and rushes in, her body moon-blue as a jellyfish, and I’m breathing deep and I’m there and I’m also not there and spurting ink over the sheets but she remains, completely unexplained or maybe I’m just too tongue-tied to drink it up and swallow back the pain. I thought slavery had been abolished, how come it’s gone and reared its ugly head again.
And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be\s This is what she does and this is what she is.\s And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be\s This is what she is and this is what she does.
This is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be\s And this is what she does and this is what she is.\s And this is the moment this is exactly what she is born to be\s This is what she does and this is what she is.
And now she’s jumping up with her leaping brain, stepping over heaps of sleeping children, disappearing and further up and spinning out again, up and further up she goes, up and out of the bed, up and out of the bed and down the hall where she stops for a moment and turns and says “Are you still here?” and then reaches high and dangles herself like a child’s dream from the ring of Saturn.\sSome go on, some stay behind, some never move at all\s Girl in amber, trapped forever, spinning down the hall\s Let no part of her go unremembered, clothes across the floor\s Girl in amber, long does slumber, shuts the bathroom door\s The phone, the phone, the phone, it rings, it rings, it rings no more\s The song, the song, the song, it spins since 1984\s The phone, the phone, the phone, it rings, the phone it rings no more\s The song, the song, its been spinning now since 1984
If you want to bleed, just bleed\s If you want to bleed, just bleed\s If you want to bleed, don’t breathe\s A word, just step away\s And let the world spinning now
You turn, you turn, you kneel lace up his shoes your little blue-eyed boy\s Take him by his hand, go moving spinning down the hall\s I get lucky I get lucky cause I tried again\s I knew the world it would stop spinning now since you’ve been gone\s I used to think that when you died you kind of wandered the world\s In a slumber until you crumbled, were absorbed into the earth\s Well I don’t think that anymore, the phone it rings no more\s The song the song it spins it spins now since 1984\s The song the song the song it spins its been spinning now\s And if you hold me I will tell you that you know that
If you want to leave, don’t breathe\s If you want to leave, don’t breathe\s If you want to leave, don’t breathe\s A word, and let the world turn
The song the song it spins the song it spins it spins no more\s The phone it rings it rings and you won’t stay
Don’t touch me\s Don’t touch me\s Don’t touch me\s Don’t touch me\sOh, mostly I never knew which way was out\s Once it was on, it was on, and that was that\s The umbilicus was a faucet that fountained rabid blood\s And I spun on my wheel like a laboratory rat
I was an electrical storm on the bathroom floor, clutching the bowl\s My blood was full of gags and other people’s diseases\s And my monstrous little memory had swallowed me whole\s Oh, it was the year I officially became the Bride of Jesus
In love in love in love you laugh in love\s You move I move and one more time with feeling\s I love you love I laugh you laugh, I saw you in half\s And the stars are splashed across the ceiling
Oh, the urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming\s I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues\s I had a sudden urge to become someone, someone like you\s Who had started out with less than anyone I ever knew
In love in love I love you love I laugh you laugh\s I move you move and one more time with feeling\s I love you love I laugh you laugh, I’m sawn in half\s And all the stars are splashed across the ceiling
And oh, you come shyly. And softly to the hole to drink\s Come as far as the edge of my blood and then swim\s And in the bathroom mirror I see me vomit in the sink\s And all through the house we hear the hyena’s hymns
Of love I love you love I love you love I laugh you laugh\s I move you move you move and one more time with feeling\s I love you love I laugh you laugh we saw each other in half\s And all the stars are splashed and splattered across the ceiling\sOh the fine wind is gone
And this sweet world is so much older
The animals pull the night around their shoulders
The flowers fall to their naked knees
Here I come now Here I come
I hear you’ve been out there looking for something to love
There’s a dark force that shifts at the edge of the trees
It’s all right It’s all right
Well, you’ve turned so long and lovely it’s hard to believe
That we’re falling now in the name of the Anthrocene
O the things we love we love we love, we lose
It’s our bodies that fall when we’re trying to rise
I hear you’ve been out looking for something to love
Sit down beside me and I’ll name it for you
Behold Behold the heaven-bound seas
The wind casts its shadow and it moves through the trees
Behold the animals and the birds and the sky entire
I hear you’ve been out there looking for something to set on fire
The head-bowed children fall to their knees
Humbled in the age of the Anthrocene
Here they come now Here they come, pulling you away
There are powers at play more forceful than we
Come over here and sit down and say a short prayer
A prayer to the air To the air that we breathe
And the astonishing rise of the Anthrocene
Come on now Come on now
Hold your breath while you say
It’s a long way back and I’m begging you please
To come home now. Come home now
I heard you’ve been out looking for something to love
Close your eyes, little world, and brace yourself.\sWhen you’re feeling like a lover
Nothing really matters anymore
I saw you standing there
In the supermarket
With your red dress falling
And your eyes to the ground
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
When the one you love is gone
It’s still in me
Baby I need you
In my heart
I need you
Cause nothing really matters
I’m standing in the doorway
You’re walking round to my place
In your red dress
Hair hanging down
With your eyes on the one
We love the ones we can
Cause nothing really matters
When you’re standing
Standing
I need you
I need you
Cause nothing really matters
We followed the lines
In the palms of our hands
You’re standing in the supermarket
Holding hands
In you red dress falling
Falling in
Falling in
And the long black cars waiting round
I will miss you when you’re gone
I’ll miss you when you’re gone
Away forever
Cause nothing really matters
I thought I knew better. So much better
And I need you
I need you
Cause nothing really matters
O that night we wrecked like a train
Purring cars
In the pouring rain
Never felt right about it
Never again
Cause nothing really matters
Cause nothing really matters anymore
Not even today
No matter how hard I try
When you’re standing in the aisle
And baby
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
I need
I need
I need you
I need you
I need you
Just breathe
Just breathe
I need you\s\sSunday morning
Skeleton tree
Well nothing is for free
In the window
A candle
Well maybe you can see
Falling leaves
Thrown
Across the sky
A jittery TV
Glowing white like fire
Nothing is for free
I call out I call out
 
Right across the sea
But the echo comes back empty
Nothing is for free
 
Sunday morning
Skeleton tree
Pressed against the sky
A jittery TV
Glowing white
Like fire
I call out I call out
Right across the sea
I call out I call out
Nothing is for free
 
And it’s all right now
And it’s all right now
And it’s all right now\sThe tree don’t care what the little bird sings\s We go down with the dew in the morning\s The trees don’t know what the little bird brings\s We go down with the dew in the

I want you to be my girlfriend
 
Maybe we could send those kids to play down on the street
Hey, shouldn’t you put shoes on their feet?
It’s getting hard to relax
It’s getting hard to relax
Gonna open up the window
Whose that coming up the back stairs?
Tippy-toe  tippy-toe  tippy-toe  tippy-toe
Coming up the back stairs
 
I can see that you don’t really dig him
And I can see that you want it to quit
But if you want to get your hand out of the cookie jar
You gonna have to let go of the biscuit
O babe I want you
I want you to be my girlfriend
Yeah, I want you
Yeah, I want to be your solitary man
I wanna be that man\sPsychedelic invocations\s Of Mata Hari at the station\s I give to you\s A Java princess of Hindu birth\s A woman of flesh, a child of the earth\s I give to you\s The hanging gardens of Babylon\s Miles Davis, the black unicorn\s I give to you\s The Palaces on Montezuma\s And the gardens of Akbar’s Tomb\s I give to you\s The Spider Goddess and the Needle Boy\s And the slave-dwarves that they employ\s I give to you\s A custard-coloured super-dream\s Of Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen\s I give to you
C’mon baby, let’s get out of the cold\s And gimme gimme gimme your precious love\s For me to hold
The Epic of Gilgamesh\s A pretty little black A-line dress\s I give to you\s The spinal cord of JFK\s Wrapped in Marilyn Monroe’s negligee\s I give to you\s I want nothing in return\s Just the softest little breathless word\s I ask of you\s A word contained in a grain of sand\s That can barely walk, can’t even stand\s I ask for you
C’mon baby, let’s get out of the cold\s And gimme gimme gimme your precious love\s For me to hold\s C’mon baby, come out of the cold\s And gimme gimme gimme your precious love\s For me to hold\sI saw my old friend Gabriel
Down the perimeter ringing a bell
I said hello
Hey man is there something wrong?
Where has everybody gone?
I don’t know
Well, I put my hand across my mouth
And I went out
Yeah, moving slow
What are you doing he said to me
I’m looking for my company
He said don’t bother, no
 
Well, next thing you l know when I took a look
Gabe was trying to sell me a book
But I got no dough
He said check it out, it’s going cheap
Check it out, it’s going cheap
I’ll give it a go
Well, I read that book, every page
And then I put it away
Said I don’t think so
It makes slaves of all of womankind
And corpses of the men
And I just don’t know
 
And we care a little bit
And we get scared a little bit
Of those two cold dead eyes that stare a little bit
And we cry a little bit
And we get by a little bit
Let your tears all come falling down
 
Put me on a big white steed
Ride it up and down your street
Wrapped up in a crimson coat
Sail me in a great big boat
I’ll sail around the waters for you
Kill your sons and daughters for you
Put me on a big white horse
Send me down to Banbury Cross

And she moves among the sparrows\s And she floats upon the breeze\s She moves among the flowers\s She moves something deep inside of me
I was walking around the flower show like a leper\s Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria\s When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair\s Up against the pink and purple wisteria\s You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me\s With some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak,\s I couldn’t speak, I was having thoughts\s That were not in my best interests to mention
And she moves among the flowers\s And she floats upon the smoke\s She moves among the shadows\s She moves me with just one little look
You took me back to your place\s And dressed me up in a deep sea diver’s suit\s You played the patriot, you raised the flag\s And I stood at full salute\s Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb\s And made it impossible to speak\s As you closed in, in slow motion,\s Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek
She moves among the shadows\s She floats upon the breeze\s She moves among the candles\s And we moved through the days\s and through the years
Years passed by, we were walking by the sea\s Half delirious\s You smiled at me and said, Babe\s I think this thing is getting kind of serious\s You pointed at something and said\s Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?\s It was then that I broke down\s It was then that you lifted me up again
She moves among the sparrows\s And she walks across the sea\s She moves among the flowers\s And she moves something deep inside of me
She moves among the sparrows\s And she floats upon the breeze\s She moves among the flowers\s And she moves right up close to me\sThe sun is high up in the sky and I’m in my car\s Drifting down into the abattoir\s Do you see what I see, dear?
The air grows heavy. I listen to your breath\s Entwined together in this culture of death\s Do you see what I see, dear?
Slide on over here, let me give you a squeeze\s To avert this unholy evolutionary trajectory\s Can you hear what I hear, babe?\s Does it make you feel afraid?
Everything’s dissolving, babe, according to plan\s The sky is on fire, the dead are heaped across the land\s I went to bed last night and my\s moral code got jammed\s I woke up this morning with a Frappucino in my hand
I kissed you once. I kissed you again\s My heart it tumbled like the stock exchange\s Do you feel what I feel, dear?
Mass extinction, darling, hypocrisy\s These things are not good for me\s Do you see what I see, dear?
The line the God throws down to you and me\s Makes a pleasing geometry\s Shall we leave this place now, dear?\s Is there someway out of here?
I wake with the sparrows and I hurry off to work\s The need for validation, babe, gone completely\s berserk\s I wanted to be your Superman but I turned out\s such a jerk\s I got the abattoir blues\s I got the abattoir blues\s I got the abattoir blues\s Right down to my shoes\sC’mon, kind Sir, let’s walk outside\s And breathe the autumn air\s See the many that have lived and died\s See the unending golden stair\s See all of us that have come behind\s Clutching at your hem\s All the way from Arkansas\s To your sweet and last amen
Let the bells ring\s He is the real thing\s Let the bells ring\s He is the real, real thing
Take this deafening thunder down\s Take this bread and take this wine\s Your passing is not what we mourn\s But the world you left behind\s Well, do not breathe, nor make a sound\s And behold your mighty work\s That towers over the uncaring ground\s Of a lesser, darker world
(Chorus)
There are those of us not fit to tie\s The laces of your shoes\s Must remain behind to testify\s Through an elementary blues\s So, let’s walk outside, the hour is late\s Through your crumbs and scattered shells\s Where the awed and the mediocre wait\s Barely fit to ring the bells
(Chorus)\sFarmer Emmerich went into his barn\s And found a cow suckling a serpent\s And a brown ape clanking a heavy chain\s Said Farmer Emmerich to the ape\s Never ask me to come into this barn again\s So Long\s Farewell\s So Long
Farmer Emmerich caught the serpent\s And the brown ape in a cage\s And took them into his house\s He fed the snake a vat of milk\s And when the ape rattled its chain\s He tossed the ape a mouse\s So Long\s Goodbye\s Farewell
The villagers found out that Farmer Emmerich\s Was nurturing a serpent\s And descended upon his farm\s All rabid in their blindness\s They dragged the snake outside\s Chopped it open with an axe\s And the ground soaked\s In the milk of human kindness\s So Long\s Farewell\s So Long
But the brown ape escaped\s And was heard to roam the ranges\s Clanking its heavy chain\s Down in the valley it sang to its friend\s Whom he may never see again\sOrpheus sat gloomy in his garden shed\s Wondering what to do\s With a lump of wood, a piece of wire\s And a little pot of glue\s O Mamma O Mamma
He sawed at the wood with half a heart\s And glued it top to bottom\s He strung a wire in between\s He was feeling something rotten\s O Mamma O Mamma
Orpheus looked at his instrument\s And he gave the wire a pluck\s He heard a sound so beautiful\s He gasped and said O my God\s O Mamma O Mamma
He rushed inside to tell his wife\s He went racing down the halls\s Eurydice was still asleep in bed\s Like a sack of cannonballs\s O Mamma O Mamma
Look what I’ve made, cried Orpheus\s And he plucked a gentle note\s Eurydice’s eyes popped from their sockets\s And her tongue burst through her throat\s O Mamma O Mamma
O God, what have I done, he said\s As her blood pooled in the sheets\s But in his heart he felt a bliss\s With which nothing could compete\s O Mamma O Mamma
Orpheus went leaping through the fields\s Strumming as hard as he did please\s Birdies detonated in the sky\s Bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees\s O Mamma O Mamma
Orpheus strummed till his fingers bled\s He hit a G minor 7\s He woke up God from a deep, deep sleep\s God was a major player in heaven\s O Mamma O Mamma
God picked up a giant hammer\s And He threw it with a thunderous yell\s It smashed down hard on Orpheus’ head\s And knocked him down a well\s O Mamma O Mamma\s The well went down very deep\s Very deep went down the well\s The well went down so very deep\s Well, the well went down to hell\s O Mamma O Mamma
Poor Orpheus woke up with a start\s All amongst the rotting dead\s His lyre tucked safe under his arm\s His brains all down his head\s O Mamma O Mamma
Eurydice appeared brindled in blood\s And she said to Orpheus\s If you play that fucking thing down here\s I’ll stick it up your orifice\s O Mamma O Mamma
This lyre lark is for the birds, said Orpheus\s It’s enough to send you bats\s Let’s stay down here, Eurydice, dear\s And we’ll have a bunch of screaming brats\s O Mamma O Mamma
Orpheus picked up his lyre for the last time\s He was on a real low down bummer\s And stared deep into the abyss and said\s This one is for Mamma
O Mamma O Mamma\s O Mamma O Mamma\sIt’s up in the morning and on the downs\s Little white clouds like gambolling lambs\s And I am breathless over you\s And the red-breasted robin beats his wings\s His throat it trembles when he sings\s For he is helpless before you\s The happy hooded bluebells bow\s And bend their heads all a-down\s Heavied by the early morning dew\s At the whispering stream, at the bubbling brook\s The fishes leap up to take a look\s For they are breathless over you\s Still your hands\s And still your heart\s For still your face comes shining through\s And all the morning glows anew
Still your mind\s Still your soul\s For still, the fire of love is true\s And I am breathless without you\s The wind circles among the trees\s And it bangs about the new-made leaves\s For it is breathless without you\s The fox chases the rabbit round\s The rabbit hides beneath the ground\s For he is defenceless without you\s The sky of daytime dies away\s And all the earthly things they stop to play\s For we are all breathless without you\s I listen to my juddering bones\s The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs\s And I am breathless without you\s Still your hands\s And still your heart\s For still your face comes shining through\s And all the morning glows anew\s Still your soul\s Still your mind\s Still, the fire of love is true\s And I am breathless without you\sStay by me, stay by me\s You are the one, my only true love
The butcher bird makes it’s noise\s And asks you to agree\s With it’s brutal nesting habits\s And it’s pointless savagery\s Now, the nightingale sings to you\s And raises up the ante\s I put one hand on your round ripe heart\s And the other down your panties
Everything is falling, dear\s Everything is wrong\s It’s just history repeating itself\s And babe, you turn me on
Like a light bulb\s Like a song
You race naked through the wilderness\s You torment the birds and the bees\s You leapt into the abyss, but find\s It only goes up to your knees\s I move stealthily from tree to tree\s I shadow you for hours\s I make like I’m a little deer\s Grazing on the flowers
Everything is collapsing, dear\s All moral sense has gone\s It’s just history repeating itself\s And babe, you turn me on
Like an idea\s Like an Atom bomb\s We stand awed inside a clearing\s We do not make a sound\s The crimson snow falls all about\s Carpeting the ground
Everything is falling, dear
All rhyme and reason gone\s It’s just history repeating itself\s And, babe, you turn me on
Like an idea\s Like an Atom bomb\sIt’s difficult. It’s very tough.\s I said to the man who’d been sleeping rough\s To sit within a fragrant breeze\s All among the nodding trees\s That hang heavy with the stuff
He threw his arms around my neck\s He brushed the tear from my cheek\s And held my soft white hand\s He was an understanding man\s He did not even barely hardly speak
Easy money\s Rain it down on the wife and the kids\s Rain it down on the house where we live\s Rain until you got nothing left to give\s And rain that ever-loving stuff down on me
All the things for which my heart yearns\s Gives joy in diminishing returns\s He kissed me on the mouth\s His hands they headed south\s And my cheek it burned
Money, man, it is a bitch\s The poor, they spoil it for the rich\s With my face pressed in the clover\s I wondered when this would be over\s And at home we are all so guilty-sad
Easy money\s Pour it down the open drain\s Pour it all through my veins\s Pour it down, yeah, let it rain\s And pour that ever-loving stuff down on me
Now, I’m sitting pretty down on the bank\s Life shuffles past at a low interest rate\s In the money-coloured meadows\s And all the interesting shadows\s They leap up, then dissipate
Easy money\s Easy money\s Easy money\s Rain it down on the wife and the kids\s Rain it down on the house where we live\s Rain it down until you got nothing left to give\s And rain that ever-loving stuff down on me\sThrough the windswept coastal trees\s Where the dead come rising from the sea\s With a teddy-bear clamped between her knees\s She says, where can my loverman be?\s Well, I’m down here, babe, with the Eskimos\s With the polar bears and the Arctic snow\s With a party of penguins who do not know\s How I can get back to thee\s Well I’m gonna ask you, babe\s Hey Ho\s Oh baby don’t you go\s Hey Ho\s Oh no no no\s Hey Ho\s Oh baby, don’t you go\s All supernatural on me\s Supernaturally
Once I was your hearts desire\s Now I am the ape hunkered by the fire\s With my knuckles dragging through the mire\s You float by so majestically\s You’re my north, my south, my east, my west\s You are the girl that I love best\s With an army of tanks bursting from your chest\s I wave my little white flag at thee
Can you see it, babe?\s Hey Ho\s Oh baby don’t you go\s Hey Ho\s Oh no no no\s Hey Ho\s Oh baby, don’t you go\s All supernatural on me\s Supernaturally
Now I’ve turned the mirrors to wall\s I’ve emptied out the peopled halls\s I’ve nailed shut the windows and locked the doors\s There is no escape, you see\s I chase you up and down the stairs\s Under tables and over chairs\s I reach out and I touch your hair\s And it cuts me like a knife\s For there is always some little thing you gotta do\s Hey Ho\s Oh baby don’t you go\s Hey Ho\s Oh baby, no no no\s Hey Ho\s Oh don’t you go\s All supernatural on me\s Supernaturally\sThrough the woods, and frosted moors\s Past the snow-caked hedgerows I\s Bed down upon the drifting snow\s Sleep beneath the melting sky\s I whisper all your names\s I know not where you are\s But somewhere, somewhere, somewhere here\s Upon this wild abandoned star
And I’m full of love\s And I’m full of wonder
And I’m full of love\s And I’m falling under\s Your spell
I have no abiding memory\s No awakening, no flaming dart\s No word of consolation\s No arrow through my heart\s Only a feeble notion\s A glimmer from afar\s That I cling to with my fingers\s As we go spinning wildly through the stars
The wind lifts me to my senses\s I rise up with the dew\s The snow turns to streams of light\s The purple heather grows anew\s I call you by your name\s I know not where you are\s But somehow, somewhere, sometime soon\s Upon this wild abandoned star\sI lay down by the river\s The shadows moved across me, inch by inch\s And all that I heard\s Was the war between the water and the bridge\s Turn to me, turn to me, turn to me\s Turn and drink of me\s Or look away, look away, look away\s And never more think of me
Carry me\s Carry me\s I heard the many voices\s Speaking to me from the depths below\s This ancient wound\s This catacomb\s Beneath the whited snow\s Come to me, come to me, come to me
Come and drink of me\s Or turn away, turn away, turn away\s And never more think of me
Carry me\s Carry me away\s Who will lay down their hammer?\s Who will put up their sword?\s And pause to see\s The mystery\s Of theWord
Carry me\s Carry me\s Carry me\s Carry me away\s Carry me\s Carry me\s Carry me\s Carry me away\sPass me that lovely little gun\s My dear, my darling one\s The cleaners are coming, one by one\s You don’t even want to let them start
They are knocking now upon your door\s They measure the room, they know the score\s They’re mopping up the butcher’s floor\s Of your broken little hearts
O children
Forgive us now for what we’ve done\s It started out as a bit of fun\s Here, take these before we run away\s The keys to the gulag
O children\s Lift up your voice, lift up your voice\s Children\s Rejoice, rejoice
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim\s They’re gathering round with all my friends\s We’re older now, the light is dim\s And you are only just beginning
O children
We have the answer to all your fears\s It’s short, it’s simple, it’s crystal clear\s It’s round about, it’s somewhere here\s Lost amongst our winnings
O children\s Lift up your voice, lift up your voice\s Children\s Rejoice, rejoice
The cleaners have done their job on you\s They’re hip to it, man, they’re in the groove\s They’ve hosed you down, you’re good as new\s They’re lining up to inspect you
O children
Poor old Jim’s white as a ghost\s He’s found the answer that was lost\s We’re all weeping now, weeping because\s There ain’t nothing we can do to protect you
O children\s Lift up your voice, lift up your voice\s Children\s Rejoice, rejoice
Hey little trainWe are all jumping on\s The train that goes to the Kingdom\s We’re happy, Ma, we’re having fun\s And the train ain’t even left the station
Hey, little trainWait for me\s I once was blind but now I see\s Have you left a seat for me?\s Is that such a stretch of the imagination?\s Hey little trainWait for me
I was held in chains but now I’m free\s I’m hanging in there, don’t you see\s In this process of elimination

Speak our secret into your hands\s And hold it in between\s Plunge your hands into the water\s And drown it in the sea\s There will be nothing between us, baby\s But the air that we breathe\s Don’t cry\s It’s a wonderful life, wonderful life\s if you can find it\s If you can find it\s If you can find it\s It’s a wonderful life that you bring\s It’s a wonderful, wonderful thing
We can build our dungeons in the air\s And sit and cry the blues\s We can stomp across this world\s With nails hammered through our shoes\s We can join that troubled chorus\s Who criticise and accuse\s It don’t matter much\s We got nothing much to lose\s But this wonderful life\s If you can find it\s And when you find it\s And when you find it\s It’s a wonderful life that you bring\s It’s a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful thing
Sometimes our secrets are all we’ve got\s With our lives we must defend\s Sometimes the air between us, babe\s Is unbearably thin\s Sometimes it’s wise to lay down your gloves\s And just give in\s Come in, come in\s Come in, come in\s To this wonderful life\s If you can find it\s And if you find it\s It’s a wonderful life that you bring\s It’s a wonderful, wonderful thing\s It’s a wonderful life\s It’s a wonderful life\sIn his boat and through the dark he rowed\s Chained to oar and the night and the wind that blowed\s Horribly ‘round his ears\s Under the bridge and into your dreams he soars\s While you lie alone in that idea-free sleep of yours\s That you’ve been sleeping now for years
And he wants you\s He wants you\s He is straight and he is true\s Ooh hoo hoo
Beneath the hanging cliffs and under the many stars where\s He will move, all amongst your tangled hair\s And deep into the sea\s And you will wake and walk and draw the blind\s And feel some presence there behind\s And turn to see what that may be\s Oh, babe, it’s me
And he wants you\s He wants you\s He is straight and he is true\s Ooh hoo hoo\sPlease forgive me\s If I appear unkind\s But any fool can tell you\s It’s all in your mind
Down in the meadow\s The old lion stirs\s Puts his hand across his mouth\s He has no use for words
Poor little girl\s With your handful of snow\s Poor little girl\s Had no way to know
And you’ve got me eating\s you’ve got me eating\s You’ve got me eating\s Right out of your hand
I mean you no harm\s When I tell you you’re blind\s Give a sucker an even break\s He’ll lose it all, every time
The airborne starlings circle\s One the frozen fields\s The hollyhocks hang harmlessly\s And the old lion yields
And you’ve got me eating\s You’ve got me eating\s You’ve got me eating\s Right out of your hand\sThis garden that I built for you\s That you sit in now and yearn\s I will never leave it, dear\s I could not bear to return\s And find it all untended\s With the trees all bended low\s This garden is our home, dear\s And I got nowhere else to go
So bring it on\s Bring it on\s Every little tear\s Bring it on\s Every useless fear\s Bring it on\s All your shattered dreams\s And I’ll scatter them into the sea\s Into the sea
The geraniums on your window sill\s The carnations, dear, and the daffodil\s Well, they’re ordinary flowers\s But they long for the light of your touch\s And of your trembling will\s Ah, you’re trembling still\s And I am trembling too\s To be perfectly honest I don’t know\s Quite else what to do
So bring it on\s Bring it on\s Every neglected dream\s Bring it on\s Every little scheme\s Bring it on\s Every little fear\s And I’ll make them disappear
So bring it on, bring it on\s Bring it on\s Every little thing\s Bring it on\s Every tiny fear\s Bring it on\s Every shattered dream\s And I’ll scatter them into the sea\sShe sat in a wicker chair, her eyes they were downcast\s She breathed in the future, by breathing out the past\s The die is done, the die is shook, the die is duly cast\s There’s a dead man in my bed, she said\s That smile you see upon his face\s It’s been there for many days\s There’s a dead man in my bed
I ain’t been feeling that good too much no more, she said, I swear\s She pointed at the bedroom door and said I ain’t going in there\s She leaped out of her seat and screamed someone’s not concentrating here\s There’s a dead man in my bed, she said\s I ain’t speaking metaphorically\s His eyes are open but he cannot see\s There’s a dead man in my bed
Then leaves outside the window waved, all brown, they were, and falling\s Even I could tell the atmosphere in here was utterly appalling\s The phone it rand incessantly but nobody was calling\s There’s a dead man in my bed, she said\s And though he keeps on taking notes\s I swear this ain’t some kind of hoax\s There’s a dead man in my bed
Now she’s in the kitchen rattling those pots and pans\s I’d cook him something nice, she said, but he refuses to wash his hands\s He used to be so good to me, but now he smells so fucking bad\s There is a dead man in my bed, she says\s I keep poking at him with my stick\s But his skin is just so fucking thick\s There’s a dead man in my bed\sThe cops are hanging around the house\s The cars outside look like they’ve got the blues\s The moon don’t know if it’s day or night\s Everybody’s creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes\s You’re making coffee for everyone concerned\s Someone points to this and someone points to that\s Everyone is saying that you should lie down\s But you ain’t having none of that\s And I say to the sleepy summer rain\s With a complete absence of pain\s You might think I’m crazy\s But I’m still in love with you
Hide your eyes, hide your tears\s Hide your face, my love\s Hide your ribbons, hide your bows\s Hide your coloured cotton gloves\s Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures\s Hide your neatly scissored locks\s Hide your memories, hide them all\s Stuff them in a cardboard box\s Or throw them into the street below\s Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow\s For you might think I’m crazy\s But I’m still in love with you
Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call\s Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all\s Now, you’re standing at the top of the stairs\s One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair\s The other one resting on your hip\s Without a solitary care\s I fall to sleep in the summer rain\s With no single memory of pain\s And you might think I’m crazy\s But I’m still in love with you\sThere is a town\s Where I was born\s Far far away\s Across the sea
And in that town\s Where I was born\s I would dream\s That one day\s I would leave\s And cross the sea
And so it goes\s And so it seems\s That God lives only in our dreams\s In our dreams
And now I live\s In this town\s I walk these dark streets\s Up and down, up and down\s Under a dark sky\s And I dream\s That one day\s I’ll go back home
And so it goes\s And so it seems\s That God lives only in our dreams\s In our dreams\sLet me say this to you\s I’ll be steadfast and true\s And my love will never falter
The sea would crash about us\s The waves would lash about us\s I’ll be your Rock of Gibraltar
The best thing I done\s Was to make you the one\s Who I’d walk with down to the altar
You’d stand by me\s And together we’d be\s That great, steady Rock of Gibraltar
Under the big yellow moon\s On our honeymoon\s I took you on a trip to Malta
And all through the night\s You held me so tight\s Your great, steady Rock of Gibraltar
Could the powers that be\s Ever forsee\s That things could so utterly alter?
All the plans that we laid\s Could soon be betrayed\s Betrayed like the Rock of Gibraltar\sShe passed by my window\s Her eyes were all aglow\s And bent to pick her glove she’d dropped\s From the bright and brittle snow
Nature had spoken it in the Spring\s With apple, plum and brand new pear\s Have you time for my company?\s No, I said, I have none to spare
You gotta sanctify my love\s You gotta sanctify my love\s You gotta sanctify my love\s I ain’t no lover-boy
For apple, plum and brand new pear\s Soon wither on the ground\s She slapped the snow from off her glove\s And move on without a sound

Chorus\sAs I sat sadly by her side\s At the window, through the glass\s She stroked a kitten in her lap\s And we watched the world as it fell past\s Softly she spoke these words to me\s And with brand new eyes, open wide\s We pressed our faces to the glass\s As I sat sadly by her side
She said,”Father, mother, sister, brother,\s Uncle, aunt, nephew, niece,\s Soldier, sailor, physician, labourer,\s Actor, scientist, mechanic, priest\s Earth and moon and sun and stars\s Planets and comets with tails blazing\s All are there forever falling\s Falling lovely and amazing”
Then she smiled and turned to me\s And waited for me to reply\s Her hair was falling down her shoulders\s As I sat sadly by her side
As I sat sadly by her side\s The kitten she did gently pass\s Over to me and again we pressed\s Our different faces to the glass\s “That may be very well”, I said\s “But watch the one falling in the street\s See him gesture to his neighbours\s See him trampled beneath their feet\s All outward motion connects to nothing\s For each is concerned with their immediate need\s Witness the man reaching up from the gutter\s See the other one stumbling on who can not see”
With trembling hand I turned toward her\s And pushed the hair out of her eyes\s The kitten jumped back to her lap\s As I sat sadly by her side
Then she drew the curtains down\s And said, “When will you ever learn\s That what happens there beyond the glass\s Is simply none of your concern?\s God has given you but one heart\s You are not a home for the hearts of your\s brothers
And God does not care for your benevolence\s Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others\s Nor does he care for you to sit\s At windows in judgement of the world He created\s While sorrows pile up around you\s Ugly, useless and over-inflated”
At which she turned her head away\s Great tears leaping from her eyes\s I could not wipe the smile from my face\s As I sat sadly by her side\sAnd no more shall we part\s It will no longer be necessary\s And no more will I say, dear heart\s I am alone and she has left me
And no more shall we part\s The contracts are drawn up, the ring is locked\s upon the finger\s And never again will my letters start\s Sadly, or in the depths of winter
And no more shall we part\s All the hatchets have been buried now\s And all of birds will sing to your beautiful heart\s Upon the bough
And no more shall we part\s Your chain of command has been silenced now\s And all of those birds would’ve sung to your\s beautiful heart\s Anyhow
Lord, stay by me\s Don’t go down\s I will never be free\s If I’m not free now
Lord, stay by me\s Don’t go down\s I never was free\s What are you talking about?
For no more shall we part\s And no more shall we part\sOn the first day of May I took to the road\s I’d been staring out the window most of the\s morning\s I’d watched the rain claw at the glass\s And a vicious wind blew hard and fast\s I should have taken it as a warning\s As a warning As a warning\s As a warning
I’d given my nurse the weekend off\s My meals were ill prepared\s My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb\s And my piano crouched in the corner of my room\s With all its teeth bared\s All its teeth bared All its teeth bared\s All its teeth bared
Hallelujah Hallelujah\s Hallelujah Hallelujah
I left my house without my coat\s Something my nurse would not have allowed\s And I took the small roads out of town\s And I passed a cow and the cow was brown\s And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud\s Like a shroud Like a shroud\s Like a shroud
There rose before me a little house\s With all hope and dreams kept within\s A woman’s voice close to my ear\s Said, “Why don’t you come in here?”\s “You looked soaked to the skin”\s Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin\s Soaked to the skin
Hallelujah Hallelujah\s Hallelujah Hallelujah
I turned to the woman and the woman was young\s I extended a hearty salutation\s But I knew if my nurse had been here\s She would never in a thousand years\s Permit me to accept that invitation\s Invitation That invitation\s That invitation
Now, you might think it wise to risk it all\s Throw caution to the reckless wind\s But with her hot cocoa and her medication\s My nurse had been my one salvation\s So I turned back home\s I turned back home I turned back home\s Singing my song
Hallelujah\s The tears are welling in my eyes again\s Hallelujah\s I need twenty big buckets to catch them in\s Hallelujah\s And twenty pretty girls to carry them down\s Hallelujah\s And twenty deep holes to bury them in\s Hallelujah\s The tears are welling in my eyes again\s Hallelujah\s I need twenty big buckets to catch them in\s Hallelujah\s And twenty pretty girls to carry them down\s Hallelujah\s And twenty deep holes to bury them in\sI hold this letter in my hand\s A plea, a petition, a kind of prayer\s I hope it does as I have planned\s Losing her again is more than I can bear\s I kiss the cold, white envelope\s I press my lips against her name\s Two hundred words. We live in hope\s The sky hangs heavy with rain
Love Letter Love Letter\s Go get her Go get her\s Love Letter Love Letter\s Go tell her Go tell her
A wicked wind whips up the hill\s A handful of hopeful words\s I love her and I always will\s The sky is ready to burst\s Said something I did not mean to say\s Said something I did not mean to say\s Said something I did not mean to say\s It all came out the wrong way
Love Letter Love Letter\s Go get her Go get her\s Love Letter Love Letter\s Go tell her Go tell her
Rain your kisses down upon me\s Rain your kisses down in storms\s And for all who’ll come before me\s In your slowly fading forms\s I’m going out of my mind\s Will leave me standing in\s The rain with a letter and a prayer\s Whispered on the wind
Come back to me\s Come back to me\s O baby please come back to me\sWhere is Mona?\s She’s long gone\s Where is Mary?\s She’s taken her along\s But they haven’t put their mittens on\s And there’s fifteen feet of pure white snow?

I waved to my neighbour\s My neighbour waved to me\s But my neighbour\s Is my enemy\s I kept waving my arms\s Till I could not see\s Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Is anybody\s Out there please?\s It’s too quiet in here\s And I’m beginning to freeze\s I’ve got icicles hanging\s From my knees\s Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Is there anybody here who feels this low?\s Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Raise your hands up to the sky\s Raise your hands up to the sky\s Raise your hands up to the sky\s Is it any wonder?\s Oh my Lord Oh my Lord\s Oh my Lord Oh my Lord
Doctor, Doctor\s I’m going mad\s This is the worst day\s I’ve ever had\s I can’t remember\s Ever feeling this bad\s Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
Where’s my nurse\s I need some healing\s I’ve been paralysed\s By a lack of feeling\s I can’t even find\s Anything worth stealing\s Under fifteen feet of pure white snow

They called at me through the fence\s They were not making any sense\s They claimed that I had lost the plot\s Kept saying that I was not\s The man I used to be\s They held their babes aloft\s Threw marsh mellows at the Security\s And said that I’d grown soft

I ain’t sent you no letters, Ma\s But I’m looking quite a trip\s The world spinning beneath me, Ma\s Guns blazing at my hip\s You were my lover\s You were my friend\s There never was no other\s On whom I could depend\s Then we came along this road\s We came along this road\s We came along this road\sPast the ivy-covered windows of The Angel\s Down Athenaeum Lane to the cathedral\s Through the churchyard I wandered\s Sat for a spell there and I pondered\s My back to the gates of the garden\s My back to the gates of the garden\s My back to the gates of the garden
Fugitive fathers, sickly infants, decent mothers\s Runaways and suicidal lovers\s Assorted boxes of ordinary bones\s Of aborted plans and sudden shattered hopes\s In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden\s In unhappy rows, up to the gates of the garden\s In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden
Won’t you meet me at the gates\s Won’t you meet me at the gates\s Won’t you meet me at the gates\s To the garden
Beneath the creeping shadow of the tower\s The bell from St. Edmunds informs me of the hour\s I turn to find you waiting there for me\s In sunlight and I see the way that you breathe\s Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden\s Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden\s Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden
Leave these ancient places to the angels\s Let the saints attend to their keeping of the\s cathedrals\s And leave the dead beneath the ground so cold\s For God is in this hand that I hold\s As we open up the gates of the garden
Won’t you meet me at the gates\s Won’t you meet me at the gates\s Won’t you meet me at the gates\s To the garden\sAs so with that, I thought I’d take a final walk\s The tide of public opinion had started to abate\s The neighbours, bless them, had turned out\s to be all talk\s I could see their frightened faces\s peering at me through the gate
I was looking for an end to this, for some kind\s of closure\s Time moved so rapidly, I had no hope of keeping\s track of it\s I thought of my friends who had died of exposure\s And I remembered other ones who had died\s from the lack of it
And in my best shoes I started falling forward\s down the street\s I stopped at a church and jostled through the crowd\s And love followed just behind me, panting at\s my feet\s As the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely\s little cloud
Inside I sat, seeking the presence of a God\s I searched through the pictures in a leatherbound book\s I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood\s And a gilled Jesus shivering on a fisherman’s hook
Babe\s It seems so long\s Since you’ve been gone away\s And I\s Just got to say\s That it grows darker with the day
Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun\s It was a Good day and an Evil day and all was\s bright and new\s And it seemed to me that most destruction was\s being done\s By those who could not choose between the two
Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboys, clones\s The streets groan with little Caesars, Napoleons\s and cunts\s With their building blocks and their tiny plastic\s phones\s Counting on their fingers, with crumbs down\s their fronts
I passed by your garden, saw you with your flowers\s The Magnolias, Camellias and Azaleas so sweet\s And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds\s You looked so beautiful in the rising heat
I smell smoke, see little fires bursting on the lawns\s People carry on regardless, listening to their hands\s Great cracks appear in the pavement, the\s earth yawns\s Bored and disgusted, to do us down
Babe\s It seems so long\s Since you’ve been gone\s And I\s Just got to say\s That it grows darker with the day
These streets are frozen now. I come and go\s Full of a longing for something I do not know\s My father sits slumped in the deepening snow\s As I search, in and out, above, about, below
Babe\s It seems so long\s Since you went away\s And I\s Just got to say\s That it grows darker with the day\sI don’t believe in an interventionist God\s But I know, darling, that you do\s But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him\s Not to intervene when it came to you\s Not to touch a hair on your head\s To leave you as you are\s And if He felt He had to direct you\s Then direct you into my arms
Into my arms, O Lord\s Into my arms, O Lord\s Into my arms, O Lord\s Into my arms
And I don’t believe in the existence of angels\s But looking at you I wonder if that’s true\s But if I did I would summon them together\s And ask them to watch over you\s To each burn a candle for you\s To make bright and clear your path\s And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love\s And guide you into my arms
Into my arms, O Lord\s Into my arms, O Lord\s Into my arms, O Lord\s Into my arms
But I believe in Love\s And I know that you do too\s And I believe in some kind of path\s That we can walk down, me and you\s So keep your candles burning\s And make her journey bright and pure\s That she will keep returning\s Always and evermore
Into my arms, O Lord\s Into my arms, O Lord\s Into my arms, O Lord\s Into my arms\sThe boatman calls from the lake\s A lone loon dives upon the water\s I put my hand over hers\s Down in the lime tree arbour\s The wind in the trees is whispering\s Whispering low that I love her\s She puts her hand over mine\s Down in the lime tree arbour
Through every breath that I breathe\s And every place I go\s There is a hand that protects me\s And I do love her so
There will always be suffering\s It flows through life like water\s I put my hand over hers\s Down in the lime tree arbour
The boatman he has gone\s And the loons have flown for cover\s She puts her hand over mine\s Down in the lime tree arbour
Through every word that I speak\s And every thing I know\s There is a hand that protects me\s And I do love her so\sPeople just ain’t no good\s I think that’s well understood\s You can see it everywhere you look\s People just ain’t no good
We were married under cherry trees\s Under blossom we made our vows\s All the blossoms come sailing down\s Through the streets and through the playgrounds
The sun would stream on the sheets\s Awoken by the morning bird\s We’d buy the Sunday newspapers\s And never read a single word
People they ain’t no good\s People they ain’t no good\s People they ain’t no good
Seasons came, seasons went\s The winter stripped the blossoms bare\s A different tree now lines the streets\s Shaking its fists in the air
The winter slammed us like a fist\s The windows rattling in the gales\s To which she drew the curtains\s Made out of her wedding veils
People they ain’t no good\s People they ain’t no good\s People they ain’t no good
To our love send a dozen white lilies\s To our love send a coffin of wood\s To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo\s That people they just ain’t no good
To our love send back all the letters\s To our love a valentine of blood\s To our love let all the jilted lovers cry\s That people they just ain’t no good
It ain’t that in their hearts they’re bad\s They can comfort you, some even try\s They nurse you when you’re ill of health\s They bury you when you go and die
It ain’t that in their hearts they’re bad\s They’d stick by you if they could\s But that’s just bullshit\s People just ain’t no good
People they ain’t no good\s People they ain’t no good\s People they ain’t no good\s People they ain’t no good\sUp those stone steps I climb\s Hail this joyful day’s return\s Into its great shadowed vault I go\s Hail the Pentecostal morn
The reading is from Luke 24\s Where Christ returns to his loved ones\s I look at the stone apostles\s Think that it’s alright for some
And I wish that I was made of stone\s So that I would not have to see\s A beauty impossible to define\s A beauty impossible to believe
A beauty impossible to endure\s The blood imparted in little sips\s The smell of you still on my hands\s As I bring the cup up to my lips
No God up in the sky\s No devil beneath the sea\s Could do the job that you did\s Of bringing me to my knees
Outside I sit on the stone steps\s With nothing much to do\s Forlorn and exhausted, baby\s By the absence of you\sJust like a bird That sings up the sun\s In a dawn so very dark\s Such is my faith for you\s Such is my faith\s And all the world’s darkness\s Can’t swallow up\s One single spark\s Such is my love for you\s Such is my love
There is a kingdom\s There is a king\s And He lives without\s And He lives within
The starry heavens above me\s The mortal law within\s So the world appears\s So the world appears\s This day so sweet\s It will never come again\s So the world appears\s Through this mist of tears
There is a kingdom\s There is a king\s And He lives without\s And He lives within\s And He is everything\sI’ve felt you coming, girl, as you drew near\s I knew you’d find me, cause I longed you here\s Are you my destiny?\s Is this how you’ll appear?\s Wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes?\s Well take that coat, babe, and throw it on the floor\s Are you the one that I’ve been waiting for?
As you’ve been moving surely toward me\s My soul has comforted and assured me\s That in time my heart it will reward me\s And that all will be revealed\s So I’ve sat and I’ve watched an ice-age thaw\s Are you the one that I’ve been waiting for?
Out of sorrow entire worlds have been built\s Out of longing great wonders have been willed\s They’re only little tears, darling, let them spill\s And lay your head upon my shoulder\s Outside my window the world has gone to war\s Are you the one that I’ve been waiting for?
O we will know, won’t we?\s The stars will explode in the sky\s O but they don’t, do they?\s Stars have their moment and then they die
There’s a man who spoke wonders\s Though I’ve never met him\s He said, ‘He who seeks finds\s And who knocks will be let in’\s I think of you in motion\s And just how close you are getting\s And how every little thing anticipates you\s All down my veins my heart-strings call\s Are you the one that I’ve been waiting for?\sI remember a girl so very well\s The carnival drums all mad in the air\s Grim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell\s O where do we go now but nowhere?
In a colonial hotel we fucked up the sun\s And then we fucked it down again\s Well the sun comes up and the sun goes down\s Going round and around to nowhere\s The kitten that padded and purred on my lap\s Now swipes at my face with the paw of a bear\s I turn the other cheek and you lay into that\s O where do we go now but nowhere?
O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up\s O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up
Across clinical benches with nothing to talk\s Breathing tea and biscuits and the Serenity Prayer\s While the bones of our child crumble like chalk\s O where do we go now but nowhere?
I remember a girl so bold and so bright\s Loose-limbed and laughing and brazen and bare\s Sits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light\s O where do we go now but nowhere?
You come for me now with a cake that you’ve made\s Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair\s Full of glass and bleach and my old razor blades\s O where do we go now but nowhere?
O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up\s O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up
If they’d give me my clothes back then I could go home\s From this fresh, this clean, antiseptic air\s Behind the locked gates an old donkey moans\s O where do we go now but nowhere?
Around the duck pond we grimly mope\s Gloomily and mournfully we go round again\s And one more doomed time and without much hope\s Going round and around to nowhere
From the balcony we watched the carnival band\s The crack of the drum a little child did scare\s I can still feel his tiny fingers pressed in my hand\s O where do we go now but nowhere?
If I could relive one day of my life\s If I could relive just a single one\s You on the balcony, my future wife\s O who could have known, but no one?
O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up\s O wake up, my love, my lover, wake up\sWith a crooked smile\s And a heart-shaped face\s Comes from the West country\s Where the birds sing bass\s She’s got a house-big heart\s Where we all live\s And plead and counsel and forgive\s Her widow’s peak, her lips I’ve kissed\s Her glove of bones at her wrist\s That I have held in my hand\s Her Spanish fly and her monkey gland\s Her Godly body and its fourteen stations\s That I have embraced, her palpitations\s Her unborn baby crying, ‘Mummy’\s Amongst the rubble of her body\s Her lovely lidded eyes I’ve sipped\s Her fingernails, all pink and chipped\s Her accent which I’m told is ‘broad’\s That I have heard and has been poured\s Into my human heart and filled me\s With love, up to the brim, and killed me\s And rebuilt me back anew\s With something to look forward to\s Well, who could ask much more than that?\s A West country girl with a big fat cat\s That looks into her eyes of green\s And meows, ‘He loves you’, then meows again\sLast night my kisses\s Were banked in black hair\s And in my bed, my lover,\s Her hair was midnight black\s And all her mystery dwelled\s Within her black hair\s And her black hair framed\s A happy heart-shaped face\s And heavy-hooded eyes\s Inside her black hair\s Shined at me from the depths\s Of her hair of deepest black\s While my fingers pushed into\s Her straight black hair\s Pulling her black hair back\s From her happy heart-shaped face\s To kiss her milk-white throat,\s A dark curtain of black hair\s Smothered me, my lover\s With her beautiful black hair\s The smell of it is heavy\s It is charged with life\s On my fingers lingers the smell\s Of her deep black hair\s Full of all my whispered words,\s Her black hair\s And wet with tears and goodbyes,\s Her hair of deepest black\s All my tears cried against\s Her milk-white throat\s Hidden behind the curtain\s Of her beautiful black hair\s As deep as ink and black,\s Black as the deepest sea\s The smell of her black hair\s Upon my pillow\s Where her head and all its\s Black hair did rest\s Today she took a train to the West\s Today she took a train to the West\s Today she took a train to the West\sAs they’re taking me down, my friend\s And as they usher me off to my end\s Will I bid you adieu?\s Or will I be seeing you soon?\s If what they say around here is true\s Then we’ll meet again\s Me and you
My time is at hand, my dove\s They’re gunna pass me to that house above\s Is Heaven just for victims, dear?\s Where only those in pain go?\s Well it take two to tango\s We will meet again, my love\s I know
If you’re in Heaven then you’ll forgive me, dear\s Because that’s what they do up there\s But if you’re in Hell, then what can I say\s You probably deserved it anyway\s I guess I’m gunna find out any day\s For we will meet again\s And there’ll be Hell to pay
Your face comes to me from the depths, dear\s Your silent mouth mouths, ‘Yes’, dear\s Dark read and big with blood\s They’re gunna shut me down, my love\s They’re gunna launch me into the stars\s Well, all things come to pass\s Yeah, Glory Hallelujah
This prayer is for you, my love\s Sent on the wings of a dove\s An idiot prayer of empty words\s Love, dear, is strictly for the birds\s We each get what we deserve\s My little snow white dove\s Rest assured\sFor you, dear, I was born\s For you I was raised up\s For you I’ve lived and for you I will die\s For you I am dying now\s You were my mad little lover\s In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over
You who are so\s Far from me\s So far from me\s Way across some cold neurotic sea\s Far from me
I would talk to you of all manner of things\s With a smile you would reply\s Then the sun would leave your pretty face\s And you’d retreat from the front of your eyes\s I keep hearing that you’re doing your best\s I hope your heart beats happy\s In your infant breast
You are so far from me\s Far from me\s Far from me
There is no knowledge but I know it\s There’s nothing to learn from that vacant voice\s That sails to me across the line\s From the ridiculous to the sublime\s It’s good to hear you’re doing so well\s But really can’t you find somebody else that you can ring and tell?
Did you ever care for me?\s Were you ever there for me? So far from me
You told me you’d stick by me\s Through the thick and through the thin\s Those were your very words\s My fair-weather friend\s You were my brave-hearted lover\s At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother
So far from me\s Far from me\s Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea\s Far from me\s Far from me\sKiss me again, rekiss me and kiss me\s Slip your frigid hands beneath my shirt\s This useless old fucker with his twinkling cunt\s Doesn’t care if he gets hurt
Green eyes, green eyes\s Green eyes, green eyes
If it were but a matter of faith\s If it were measured in petitions and prayer\s She would materialise, all fleshed out\s But it is not, nor do I care
Green eyes, green eyes\s Green eyes, green eyes
So hold me and hold me, don’t tell me your name\s This morning will be wiser than this evening is\s Then leave me to my enemied dreams\s And be quiet as you are leaving, Miss
Green eyes, green eyes\s Green eyes, green eyes\sHave mercy on me, sir\s Allow me to impose on you\s I have no place to stay\s And my bones are cold right through\s I will tell you a story\s Of a man and his family\s And I swear that it is true
Ten years ago I met a girl named Joy\s She was a sweet and happy thing\s Her eyes were bright blue jewels\s And we were married in the spring\s I had no idea what happiness a little love could bring\s Or what life had in store\s But all things move toward their end\s All things move toward their end\s On that you can be sure
La la la la la la la la la la\s La la la la la la la la la la
Then one morning I awoke to find her weeping\s And for many days to follow\s She grew so sad and lonely\s Became Joy in name only\s Within her breast there launched an unnamed sorrow\s And a dark and grim force set sail\s Farewell happy fields\s Where joy forever dwells\s Hail horrors hail
Was it an act of contrition or some awful premonition\s As if she saw into the heart of her final blood-soaked night\s Those lunatic eyes, that hungry kitchen knife\s Ah, I see, sir, that I have your attention\s Well, could it be?\s How often I’ve asked that question\s Well, then in quick succession\s We had babies, one, two, three
We called them Hilda, Hattie and Holly\s They were their mother’s children\s Their eyes were bright blue jewels\s And they were quiet as a mouse\s There was no laughter in the house\s No, not from Hilda, Hattie or Holly\s “No wonder”, people said, “poor mother Joy’s so melancholy”\s Well, one night there came a visitor to our little home
I was visiting a sick friend\s I was a doctor then\s Joy and the girls were on their own
La la la la la la la la la la\s La la la la la la la la la la
Joy had been bound with electrical tape\s In her mouth a gag\s She’d been stabbed repeatedly\s And stuffed into a sleeping bag\s In their very cots my girls were robbed of their lives\s Method of murder much the same as my wife’s\s Method of murder much the same as my wife’s\s It was midnight when I arrived home\s Said to the police on the telephone\s Someone’s taken four innocent lives
They never caught the man\s He’s still on the loose\s It seems he has done many many more\s Quotes John Milton on the walls in the victim’s blood\s The police are investigating at tremendous cost\s In my house he wrote, “red right hand”\s That, I’m told is from Paradise Lost\s The wind round here gets wicked cold\s But my story is nearly told\s I fear the morning will bring quite a frost
And so I’ve left my home\s I drift from land to land\s I am upon your step and you are a family man\s Outside the vultures wheel\s The wolves howl, the serpents hiss\s And to extend this small favour, friend\s Would be the sum of earthly bliss\s Do you reckon me a friend?\s The sun to me is dark\s And silent as the moon\s Do you, sir, have a room?\s Are you beckoning me in?\s La la la la la la la la la la\s La la la la la la la la la la\s La la la la la la la la la la\s La la la la la la la la la la\sIt was back in ‘32 when times were hard\s He had a Colt .45 and a deck of cards\s Stagger Lee
He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat\s Had a ‘28 Ford, had payments on that\s Stagger Lee
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow\s And told him, “Never ever come back no more”\s Stagger Lee
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the mud\s Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood\s Stagger Lee
He said, “Mr Motherfucker, you know who I am”\s The barkeeper said, “No, and I don’t give a good goddamn”\s To Stagger Lee
He said, “Well bartender, it’s plain to see\s I’m that bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee”\s Mr. Stagger Lee
Barkeep said, “Yeah, I’ve heard your name down the way\s And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day”\s Mr Stagger Lee
Well, those were the last words that the barkeep said\s ‘Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head
Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown\s Was known to make more money than any bitch in town
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt\s Over to Stagger Lee, she starts to flirt\s With Stagger Lee
She saw the barkeep, said, “O God, he can’t be dead”\s Stag said, “Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker’s head”
She said, “You look like you ain’t scored in quite a time.\s Why not come to my pad? It won’t cost you a dime”\s Mr. Stagger Lee
“But there’s something I have to say before you begin\s You’ll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in,\s Stagger Lee”
“I’ll stay here till Billy Dilly comes in, till time comes to pass\s And furthermore I’ll fuck Billy Dilly in his motherfucking ass”\s Said Stagger Lee
“I’m a bad motherfucker, don’t you know\s And I’ll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get to one fat boy’s asshole”\s Said Stagger Lee
Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and said, “You must be\s That bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee”\s Stagger Lee
“Yeah, I’m Stagger Lee and you better get down on your knees\s And suck my dick, because if you don’t you’re sure to be dead”\s Said Stagger Lee
Billy Dilly dropped down and slobbered on his head\s And Stag filled him full of lead\s Oh yeah.\sGet down, get down, little Henry Lee\s And stay all night with me\s You won’t find a girl in this damn world\s That will compare with me\s And the wind did howl and the wind did blow\s La la la la la\s La la la la lee\s A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
I can’t get down and I won’t get down\s And stay all night with thee\s For the girl I have in that merry green land\s I love far better than thee\s And the wind did howl and the wind did blow\s La la la la la\s La la la la lee\s A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
She leaned herself against a fence\s Just for a kiss or two\s And with a little pen-knife held in her hand\s She plugged him through and through\s And the wind did roar and the wind did moan\s La la la la la\s La la la la lee\s A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
Come take him by his lilly-white hands\s Come take him by his feet\s And throw him in this deep deep well\s Which is more than one hundred feet\s And the wind did howl and the wind did blow\s La la la la la\s La la la la lee\s A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
Lie there, lie there, little Henry Lee\s Till the flesh drops from your bones\s For the girl you have in that merry green land\s Can wait forever for you to come home\s And the wind did howl and the wind did moan\s La la la la la\s La la la la lee\s A little bird lit down on Henry Lee\sThere she stands, this lovely creature\s There she stands, there she stands\s With her hair full of ribbons\s And green gloves on her hands
So I asked this lovely creature\s Yes, I asked. Yes, I asked\s Would she walk with me a while\s Through this night so fast
She took my hand, this lovely creature\s “Yes”, she said, “Yes”, she said\s “Yes, I’ll walk with you a while”\s It was a joyful man she led
Over hills, this lovely creature\s Over mountains, over ranges\s By great pyramids and sphinxs\s We met drifters and strangers
Oh the sands, my lovely creature\s And the mad, moaning winds\s At night the deserts writhed\s With diabolical things
Through the night, through the night\s The wind lashed and it whipped me\s When I got home, my lovely creature\s She was no longer with me
Somewhere she lies, this lovely creature\s Beneath the slow drifting sands\s With her hair full of ribbons\s And green gloves on her hands\sThey call me The Wild Rose\s but my name was Elisa Day\s Why they call me it I do not know\s For my name was Elisa Day
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one\s As she stared in my eyes and smiled\s For her lips were the colour of the roses\s That grew down the river, all bloody and wild
When he knocked on my door and entered the room\s My trembling subsided in his sure embrace\s He would be my first man, and with a careful hand\s He wiped at the tears that ran down my face
They call me The Wild Rose\s but my name was Elisa Day\s Why they call me it I do not know\s For my name was Elisa Day
On the second day I brought her a flower\s She was more beautiful than any woman I’d seen\s I said, “Do you know where the wild roses grow\s So sweet and scarlet and free?”
On the second day he came with a single red rose\s Said: “Will you give me your loss and your sorrow?”\s I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed\s He said, “If I show you the roses will you follow?”
They call me The Wild Rose\s but my name was Elisa Day\s Why they call me it I do not know\s For my name was Elisa Day
On the third day he took me to the river\s He showed me the roses and we kissed\s And the last thing I heard was a muttered word\s As he stood smiling above me with a rock in his fist
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow\s And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief\s As I kissed her goodbye, I said, “All beauty must die”\s And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth
They call me The Wild Rose\s but my name was Elisa Day\s Why they call me it I do not know\s For my name was Elisa Day\sI live in a town called Millhaven\s And it’s small and it’s mean and it’s cold\s But if you come around just as the sun goes down\s You can watch the whole town turn to gold\s It’s around about then that I used to go a-roaming\s Singing La la la la La la la lie\s All God’s children they all gotta die
My name is Loretta but I prefer Lottie\s I’m closing in on my fifteenth year\s And if you think you have seen a pair of eyes more green\s Then you sure didn’t see them round here\s My hair is yellow and I’m always a-combing\s La la la la La la la lie\s Mama often told me we all have to die
You must have heard about The Curse Of Millhaven\s How last Christmas Bill Blake’s little boy didn’t come home\s They found him next week in One Mile Creek\s His head bashed in and his pockets full of stones\s Well, just imagine the wailing and moaning\s La la la la La la la lie\s Even little Billy Blake, he had to die
Then Professor O’Rye from Millhaven High\s Found nailed to his door, his prize-winning terrier\s The next day the old fool brought little Biko to school\s And we all had to watch as he buried her\s His eulogy to Biko had all the tears a-flowing\s La la la la La la la lie\s Even God’s little creatures, they have to die
Our little town fell into a state of shock\s A lot of people were saying things that made little sense\s Then the next thing you know the head of Handyman Joe\s Was found in the fountain of the Mayor’s residence\s Foul play can really get a small town going\s La la la la La la la lie\s All God’s children all have to die
Then, in a cruel twist of fate, old Mrs Colgate\s Was stabbed but the job was not complete\s The last thing she said before the cops pronounced her dead\s Was, “My killer is Loretta and she lives across the street”\s Twenty cops burst through my door without even phoning\s La la la la La la la lie\s The young ones, the old ones, they all gotta die
Yes, it is I, Lottie. The curse of Millhaven\s I’ve struck horror in the heart of this town\s Like my eyes ain’t green and my hair ain’t yellow\s It’s more like the other way around\s I gotta pretty little mouth underneath all the foaming\s La la la la La la la lie\s Sooner or later we all gotta die
Since I was no bigger than a weavil they’ve been saying I was evil\s That if “bad” was a boot then I’d fit it\s That I’m a wicked young lady, but I’ve been trying hard lately\s O fuck it I’m a monster I admit it\s It makes me so mad my blood really starts a-going\s La la la la La la la lie\s Mama always told me that we all gotta die
Yeah, I drowned the Blakey kid, stabbed Mrs. Colgate, I admit\s Did the handyman with his circular saw in his garden shed\s But I never crucified little Biko, that was two junior high school psychos\s Stinky Bohoon and his friend with the pumpkin-sized head\s I’ll sing to the lot, now you got me going\s La la la la La la la lie\s All God’s children have all gotta die
There were all of the others, all our sisters and brothers\s You assumed were accidents, best forgotten\s Recall the children who broke through the ice on Lake Tahoo?\s Everyone assumed the “Warning” signs had followed them to the bottom\s Well, they’re underneath the house where I do quite a bit of stowing\s La la la la La la la lie\s Even twenty little children, they had to die
And the fire of ‘91 that razed the Bella Vista slum\s There was the biggest shit-fight this country’s ever seen\s Insurance companies ruined, land lords getting sued\s All cause of a wee little girl with a can of gasoline\s Those flames really roared when the wind started blowing\s La la la la La la la lie\s Rich man, poor man, all got to die
Well I confessed to all these crimes and then they put me on trial\s I was laughing when they took me away\s Off to the asylum in an old black Mariah\s It ain’t home, but you know, it’s fucking better than jail\s It ain’t such a bad old place to have a home in\s La la la la La la la lie\s All God’s children they all gotta die
Now I got shrinks that will not rest with their endless Rorschach tests\s I keep telling them they’re out to get me\s They ask me if I feel remorse and I answer, “Why of course\s There is so much more I could have done if they’d let me”\s So it’s Rorschach and Prozac and everything is groovy\s Singing La la la la La la la lie\s All God’s children have all gotta die\s La la la la La la la lie\s I’m happy as a lark and everything is fine\s Singing La la la la La la la lie\s Yeah, everything is groovy and everything is fine\s Singing La la la la La la la lie\s All God’s children they all gotta die\sThey found Mary Bellows cuffed to the bed\s With a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head\s O poor Mary Bellows
She’d grown up hungry, she’d grown up poor\s So she left her home in Arkansas\s O poor Mary Bellows
She wanted to see the deep blue sea\s She drove across Tennessee\s O poor Mary Bellows
She met a man along the way\s He introduced himself as Richard Slade\s O poor Mary Bellows
Poor Mary thought that she might die\s When she saw the ocean for the first time\s O poor Mary Bellows
She checked into a cheap little place\s Richard Slade carried in her old suitcase\s O poor Mary Bellows
“I’m a good girl, sir,” she said to him\s I couldn’t possibly permit you in\s O poor Mary Bellows
Slade tipped his hat and winked his eye\s And turned away without goodbye\s O poor Mary Bellows
She sat on her bed and thought of home\s With the sea breeze whistling all alone\s O poor Mary Bellows
In hope and loneliness she crossed the floor\s And undid the latch on the front door\s O poor Mary Bellows
They found her next day cuffed to the bed\s A rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head\s O poor Mary Bellows
So mothers keep your girls at home\s Don’t let them journey out alone\s Tell them this world is full of danger\s And to shun the company of strangers\s O poor Mary Bellows\s O poor Mary Bellows\sCrow Jane Crow Jane\s Crow Jane\s Horrors in her head\s That her tongue dare not name\s Lived all alone by the river\s The rolling rivers of pain\s Crow Jane Crow Jane\s Crow Jane Ah hah huh
There is one shining eye on a hard-hat\s Company closed down the mine\s Winking on the waters they came\s Twenty hard-hats, twenty eyes\s In her clapboard shack\s Just six foot by five\s They killed all her whiskey\s Poured their pistols dry\s Crow Jane Crow Jane\s Crow Jane Ah hah huh
Seems you’ve remembered\s How to sleep, how to sleep\s The house dogs are in your turnips\s And your yard dogs are running all over the streets\s Crow Jane Crow Jane\s Crow Jane Ah hah huh
“O Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson\s Why you close up shop so late?”\s “Just fitted out a girl who looked like a bird\s Measured .32, .44, .38\s Asked that girl which road she was taking\s Said she was walking the road of hate\s But she hopped on a coal-trolley up to New Haven\s Population: 48”\s Crow Jane Crow Jane\s Crow Jane Ah hah huh
Your guns are drunk and smoking\s They have followed you to the gate\s Laughing all the way back from the new town\s Population, now, 28\s Crow Jane Crow Jane\s Crow Jane Ah hah huh\sI am tall and I am thin\s Of an enviable height\s And I’ve been known to be quite handsome\s From a certain angle and in a certain light\s Well I entered into O’Malley’s\s Said, “O’Malley I have a thirst”\s O’Malley merely smiled at me\s Said “You wouldn’t be the first”\s I knocked on the bar and pointed\s To a bottle on the shelf\s And as O’Malley poured me out a drink\s I sniffed and crossed myself\s My hand decided that the time was nigh\s And for a moment it slipped from view\s And when it returned, it fairly burned\s With confidence anew\s Well the thunder from my steely fist\s Made all the glasses jangle\s When I shot him, I was so handsome\s It was the light, it was the angle
Huh Hmmmmm
“Neighbours” I cried, “Friends” I screamed\s I banged my fist upon the bar\s “I bear no grudge against you”\s And my dick felt long and hard\s “I am the man for which no God waits\s For which the whole world yearns\s I’m marked by darkness and by blood\s And one thousand powder-burns”\s Well, you know those fish with the swollen lips\s That clean the ocean floor?\s When I looked at poor O’Malley’s wife\s That is exactly what I saw\s I jammed the barrel under her chin\s And her face looked raw and vicious\s Her head it landed in the sink\s With all the dirty dishes\s Her little daughter Siobhan\s Pulled beers from dusk till dawn\s And amongst the townfolk, she was a bit of a joke\s But she pulled the best beers in town\s I swooped magnificent upon her\s As she sat shivering in her grief\s Like the Madonna painted on the church-house wall\s In whale’s blood and banana leaf\s Her throat it crumbled in my fist\s And I spun heroically around\s To see Caffrey rising from his chair\s I shot that mother fucker down
Mmmmmmmmm Yeah Yeah Yeah
“I have no free will,” I sang\s As I flew about the murder\s Mrs. Richard Holmes, she screamed\s You really should have heard her\s I sang and I laughed, I howled and I wept\s I panted like a pup\s I blew a hole in Mrs. Richard Holmes\s And her husband he stood up\s And he screamed, “You are an evil man”\s And I paused a while to wonder\s “If I have no free will then how can I\s Be morally culpable, I wonder”\s I shot Richard Holmes in the stomach\s And gingerly he sat down\s And he whispered weirdly, “No offense”\s And lay upon the ground\s “None taken,” I replied to him\s With which he gave a little cough\s With blazing wings I neatly aimed\s And blew his head completely off\s I’ve lived in this town for thirty years\s And to no-one am I a stranger\s And I put new bullets in my gun\s Chamber upon chamber\s And when I turned my gun on the bird-like Mr. Brookes\s I thought of Saint Francis and his sparrows\s And as I shot down the youthful Richardson\s It was St. Sebastian I thought of, and his arrows
Hhhhhhhhhhhh Mmmmmmmmm
I said, “I want to introduce myself\s And I am glad that you all came”\s And I leapt upon the bar\s And shouted out my name\s Well Jerry Bellows, he hugged his stool\s Closed his eyes and shrugged and laughed\s And with an ashtray as big as a fucking big brick\s I split his head in half\s His blood spilled across the bar\s Like a steaming scarlet brook\s And I knelt at it’s edge on the counter\s Wiped the tears away and looked\s Well, the light in there was blinding\s Full of God and ghosts and truth\s I smiled at Henry Davenport\s Who made an attempt to move\s Well, from the position I was standing\s The strangest thing I ever saw\s The bullet entered through the top of his chest\s And blew his bowels out on the floor\s Well I floated down the counter\s Showing no remorse\s I shot a hole in Kathleen Carpenter\s Recently divorced\s But remorse I felt and remorse I had\s It clung to every thing\s From the raven’s hair upon my head\s To the feathers on my wings\s Remorse squeezed my hand in it’s fraudulent claw\s With it’s golden hairless chest\s And I glided through the bodies\s And killed the fat man Vincent West\s Who sat quietly in his chair\s A man become a child\s And I raised the gun up to his head\s Executioner-style\s He made no attempt to resist\s So fat and dull and lazy\s “Do you know I lived in your street?” I cried\s And he looked at me as though I were crazy\s “O”, he said, “I had no idea”\s And he grew as quiet as a mouse\s And the roar of the pistol when it went off\s Near blew the hat right off the house
Well, I caught my eye in the mirror\s And gave it a long and loving inspection\s “There stands some kind of man”, I roared\s And there did, in the reflection\s My hair combed back like a raven’s wing\s My muscles hard and tight\s And curling from the business end of my gun\s Was a query-mark of cordite\s Well I spun to the left, I spun to the right\s And I spun to the left again\s “Fear me Fear me”\s But no one did cause they were dead
Huh Hmmmmmmmm
And then there were the police sirens wailing\s And a bull-horn squelched and blared\s “Drop your weapons and come out\s With your hands held in the air”\s Well, I checked the chambers of my gun\s Saw I had one final bullet left\s My hand, it looked almost human\s As I held it to my head\s “Drop your weapon and come out\s Keep your hands above your head”\s Well, I had one long hard think about dying\s And did exactly what they said\s There must have been fifty cops out there\s In a circle around O’Malley’s bar\s “Don’t shoot”, I cried, “I’m a man unarmed”\s So they put me in their car\s And they sped me away from that terrible scene\s And I glanced out of the window\s Saw O’Malley’s bar, saw the cops and the cars\s And started counting on my fingers

Christina the Astonishing\s Was the most astonishing of all\s She prayed balanced on a hurdle\s Or curled up into a ball\s She fled to remote places\s Climbed towers and trees and walls\s To escape the stench of human corruption\s Into an oven she did crawl
O Christina the Astonishing\s Behaved in a terrifying way\s She would run wildly through the streets\s Jump in the Meusse and swim away\s O Christina the Astonishing\s Behaved in a terrifying manner\s Died at the age of seventy-four\s In the convent of St Anna\sWhen I first came to town\s All the people gathered round\s They bought me drinks\s Lord, how they quickly changed their tune
When I first came to town\s People took me round from end to end\s Like someone make take round a friend\s O how quickly they changed their tune
Suspicion and dark murmurs surround me\s Everywhere I go they confound me\s As though the blood on my hands\s Is there for every citizen to see
O sweet Jesus\s There is no turning back\s There is always one more town\s A little further down the track
And from my window, across the tracks\s I watch the juicers burn their fires\s And in that light\s Their faces leer at me\s How I wish they’d just let me be
When I first came to town\s Their favours were for free\s Now even the doors of the whores of this town\s Are closed to me
I search the mirror\s And I try to see\s Why the people of this town\s Have washed their hands of me
O sweet Jesus\s There is no turning back\s There is always one more town\s A little further down the track
O Lord, every god-damn turn I take\s I fear the noose, I fear the stake\s For there is no bone\s They did not break\s In all the towns I’ve been before
Well those that sin against me are snuffed out\s I know from every day that I live\s God-damn the day that I was born\s The night that forced me from the womb\s And god-damn this town\s For I am leaving now\s But one day I will return\s And the people of this town will surely see\s Just how quickly the tables turn
O sweet Jesus\s This really is the end\s There is always one more town\s A little further round the bend\sWell the night was deep and the night was dark\s And I was at the old dance-hall on the edge of town\s Some big ceremony was going down\s Dancers writhed and squirmed and then,\s Came apart and then writhed again\s Like squirming flies on a pin\s In the heat and in the din\s Yes, in the heat and in the din\s I fell to thinking about the brand new wife of mad John Finn
Well, midnite came and a clock did strike\s And in she came, did John Finn’s wife\s With legs like scissors and butcher’s knives\s A tattooed breast and flaming eyes\s And a crimson carnation in her teeth\s Carving her way through the dance floor\s And I’m standing over by the bandstand\s Every eye gaping on John Finn’s wife\s Yeah, every eye gaping on John Finn’s wife
Now John Finn’s wife was something of a mystery\s In a town where to share a sworn secret was a solemn duty\s I had brass knuckles and a bolo knife\s Over near the bandstand with John Finn’s wife\s She got perfumed breasts and raven hair\s Sprinkled with wedding confettis\s And a gang of garrotters were all giving me stares\s Armed, as they were, with machetes\s And the night through the window was full of lights\s Winking and a-watching at John Finn’s wife\s Winking and a-watching at John Finn’s wife
Next came the cops, all out on the town\s But it don’t look like no trouble there\s As they head for the bar in their lumpy suits\s And I slip my hand between the thighs of John Finn’s wife\s And they seemed to yawn awake, her thighs\s It was a warm and very ferocious night\s The moon was full of blood and light\s And my eyes grew small and my eyes grew tight\s As I plotted in the ear of John Finn’s wife
Enter John Finn in his shrunken suit\s With his quick black eyes and black cheroot\s With his filed-down teeth and a hobnail boot\s And his fists full of pistols in his pockets\s Aiming at me and aiming at his wife\s The band fall silent fearing for their lives\s And with fear in my guts like tangled twine\s Cause all i got is brass knuckles and a bolo knife\s And mad John Finn’s wife is all\s And the three of us walk out of the hall
Now the night bore down upon us all\s You could hear the crickets in the thickets call\s And the guns did flare and the guns did bawl\s And I planted my bolo knife in the neck\s Of mad John Finn. I took his wretched life\s Now I’m over near the bandstand\s Every hand moving on John Finn’s wife\s Every hand moving on John Finn’s wife
And John Finn’s wife\s Took all the flowers down\s From her hair\s And threw them on the ground\s And the flies did hum\s And the flies did buzz around\s Poor John Finn\s Lying dead upon the ground\s Lying dead upon the ground\sIt was the dirty end of winter\s Along the loom of the land\s When I walked with sweet Sally\s Hand upon hand
And the wind it bit bitter\s For a boy of no means\s With no shoes on his feet\s And a knife in his jeans
Along the loom of the land\s The mission bells peeled\s From the tower of Saint Mary’s\s Down to Reprobate Fields
And I saw that the world\s Was all blessed and bright\s And Sally breathed softly\s In the majestic night
O baby please don’t cry\s And try to keep\s Your little head upon my shoulder\s Now go to sleep
The elms and the poplars\s Were turning their backs\s Past the rumbling station\s We followed the tracks
We found an untrodden path\s And followed it down\s The moon in the sky\s Like a dislodged crown
My hands they burned\s In the folds of her coat\s Breathing milky white air\s From deep in her throat
O baby please don’t cry\s And try to keep\s Your little head upon my shoulder\s Now go to sleep
I told Sally in whispers\s I’ll never bring you harm\s Her breast it was small\s And warm in my palm
I told her the moon\s Was a magical thing\s That it shone gold in the winter\s And silver in the spring
And we walked and we walked\s Across the endless sands\s Just me and my Sally\s Along the loom of the land
O baby please don’t cry\s And try to keep\s Your little head upon my shoulder\s Now go to sleep\sI got a woman\s She rules my house with an iron fist\s I got a woman\s She rules my house with an iron fist\s She screams out Jack the Ripper\s Every time I try to give that girl a kiss
I got a woman\s She strikes me down with a fist of lead\s I got a woman\s She strikes me down with a hand of lead\s We bed in a bucket of butcher’s knives\s I awake with a hatchet hanging over my head
Well you know the story of the viper\s It’s long and lean with a poison tooth\s Yeah, you know the story of the viper\s It’s long and lean with a poison tooth\s Well they’re hissing under the floorboards\s Hanging down in bunches from my roof
I got a woman\s She just hollers what she wants from where she is\s I got a woman\s She just hollers what she wants from where she’s at\s She screams out Jack the Ripper\s Every time I try to give that girl a kiss\sFoi na cruz, foi na cruz\s Que um dia\s Meus pecados castigados em Jesus\s Foi na cruz\s Que um dia\s Foi na cruz

And the spears of the bright sun\s All brave with its conquest\s Did hover unearthly\s In banners of fire\s I knelt in the garden\s Awash with the dawning\s And a voice came so brightly\s I covered my eyes
Thank you for giving\s This bright new morning\s So steeped seemed the evening\s In darkness and blood\s There’ll be no sadness\s There’ll be no sorrow\s There’ll be no road too narrow\s There’ll be a new day\s And it’s today\s For us\sDown the road I look and there runs Mary\s Hair of gold and lips like cherries\s We go down to the river where the willows weep\s Take a naked root for a lover’s seat\s That rose out of the bitten soil\s But bound to the ground by creeping ivy coils\s O Mary you have seduced my soul\s (And I don’t know right from wrong)\s Forever a hostage of your child’s world
And then I ran my tin-cup heart along\s The prison of her ribs\s And with a toss of her curls\s That little girl goes wading in\s Rollin her dress up past her knee\s Turning these waters into wine\s Then she platted all the willow vines
Mary in the shallows laughing\s Over where the carp dart\s Spooked by the new shadows that she cast\s Across these sad waters and across my heart\sAnd no-one saw the carny go\s And the weeks flew by\s Until they moved on the show\s Leaving his caravan behind\s It was parked out on the south east ridge\s And as the company crossed the bridge\s With the first rain filling the bone-dry river bed\s It shone, just so, upon the edge\s Away, away, we’re sad, they said
Dog-boy, atlas, half-man, the geeks, the hired hands\s There was not one among them that did not cast an eye behind\s In the hope that the carny would return to his own kind\s And the carny had a horse, all skin and bone\s A bow-backed nag, that he named “Sorrow”\s Now it is buried in a shallow grave\s In the then parched meadow
And the dwarves were given the task of digging the ditch\s And laying the nag’s carcass in the ground\s And boss Bellini, waving his smoking pistol around\s Saying, “The nag is dead meat”\s “We can’t afford to carry dead weight”\s The whole company standing about\s Not making a sound\s And turning to dwarves perched on the enclosure gate\s The boss says “Bury this lump of crow bait”
And then the rain came hammering down\s Everybody running for their wagons\s Tying all the canvas flaps down\s The mangy cats growling in their cages\s The bird-girl flapping and squawking around\s The whole valley reeking of wet beast\s Wet beast and rotten hay\s Freak and brute creation\s Packed up and on their way
The three dwarves peering from their wagon’s hind\s Moses says to Noah “We shoulda dugga deepa one”\s Their grizzled faces like dying moons\s Still dirty from the digging done\s And Charlie, the eldest of the three, said\s “I guess the carny ain’t gonna show”\s And they were silent for a spell\s Wishing they’d done a better job of burying Sorrow
And as the company passed from the valley\s Into higher ground\s The rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow\s And on the mound\s Until nothing was left, nothing at all\s Except the body of Sorrow\s That rose in time\s To float upon the surface of the eaten soil
And a murder of crows did circle round\s First one, then the others flapping blackly down\s And the carny’s van still sat upon the edge\s Tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge\s And the rain it hammered down\s And no-one saw the carny go I say it’s funny how things go\sI am a crooked man\s And I’ve walked a crooked mile\s Night, the shameless widow\s Doffed her weeds, in a pile\s The stars all winked at me\s They shamed a child\s Your funeral, my trial
A thousand Marys lured me\s To feathered beds and fields of clover\s Bird with crooked wing cast\s It’s wicked shadow over\s A bauble moon did mock\s And trinket stars did smile\s Your funeral, my trial
Here I am, little lamb\s Let all the bells in whoredom ring\s All the crooked bitches that she was\s (Mongers of pain)\s Saw the moon\s Become a fang\s Your funeral, my trial\sStranger than kindness\s Bottled light from hotels\s Spilling everything\s Wet hand from the volcano\s Sobers your skin\s Stranger than kindness
You caress yourself\s And grind my soft cold bones below\s Your map of desire Burned in your flesh\s Even a fool can come\s A strange lit stair\s And find a rope hanging there\s Stranger than kindness
Keys rain like heaven’s hair\s There is no home there is no bread\s We sit at the gate and scratch\s The gaunt fruit of passion\s Dies in the light\s Stranger than kindness
Your sleeping hands journey\s They loiter\s Stranger than kindness\s You hold me so carelessly close\s Tell me I’m dirty\s Stranger than kindness\sThey dragged Jack and his shadow\s From the hole\s And the bulb that burned above him\s Did shine both day and night\s And his shadow learned to love his\s Little darks and greater light
And the sun it shined\s And the sun it shined\s And the sun it shined\s A little stronger
Jack wept and kissed his shadow  “Goodbye”\s Spat from their dirty dungeons\s Into a truly different din\s Shat from their institutions\s Into a fully different din\s And his shadow soon became a wife\s And children plagued his latter life\s Until one night he took a skinning knife\s And stole into the town\s And tracked his shadow down
Said the shadow to Jack Henry\s “What’s wrong?”\s Jack said “A home is not a hole”\s “And Shadow, you’re just a gallow that I hang my body from”\s “O Shadow, your a shackle from which my time is never done”\s Then he peeled his shadow off in strips\s He peeled his shadow off in strips\s Then kneeled his shadow on some steps\s And cried “What have I done?”
And the sun it shined\s And the sun it shined\s I say “Love is blind”\s “And is it any wonder?”\s “Is it any wonder?”
Jack and his damned shadow\s Is gone\s And though each one of us are want to duly mourn\s And though each one of us are want to duly mourn\s ‘Tis done in brighter corners now\s ‘Tis done in brighter corners now\s Now that Jack’s black shadow’s gone
And the sun it shines\s And the sun it shines\s And the sun it shines\s A little stronger\s I swear, love is blind\s Ooh love is blind\s Yeah love is blind\s And is it any wonder?\s ‘Tis done in brighter corners now\s ‘Tis done in brighter corners now\s Now that Jack’s black shadow’s gone\sIt is for she that the cherry bleeds\s That the moon is steeped in milk and blood\s That I steal like a robber\s From her altar of love\s O money lender\s O cloven gender\s I am the fiend hid in her skirts\s And it’s as hot as hell in here\s Coming at her as I am from above
Hard on for love hard on for love\s Hard on for love hard on for love
Well, I swear I seen that girl before\s Like she walked straight outta the book of Leviticus\s But they can stone me with stones I don’t care\s Just as long as I can get to kiss\s Those gypsy lips Gypsy lips\s My aim is to hit this Miss\s And I’m movin’ in (I’m movin’ in)\s Coming at her like Lazarus from above
Hard on for love hard on for love\s Hard on for love hard on for love
The Lord is my shepard I shall not want\s The Lord is my shepard I shall not want\s But he leadeth me like a lamb to the lips\s Of the mouth of the valley of the shadow of death\s I am his rod and his staff\s I am his sceptre and shaft\s And she is heaven and hell\s At whose gates I ain’t been delivered\s I’m gunna give them gates a shove

And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over\s But she fell away\s She fell away\s I did not see the cracks form\s As I knelt to pray\s I did not see the crevice yawn, no\s Sometimes\s At night I feel the end it is at hand\s My pistol going crazy in my hand\s For she fell away\s O she fell away\s Walked me to the brink\s Then fell away I did not see her fall\s To better days\s Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all\s She fell away\s She fell away\s She fell away\sYeah, they came to take me away\s Said I’d be sitting here for the rest of my life\s But I don’t really care – I shot my wife\s And brother, I can’t even remember the reason why
